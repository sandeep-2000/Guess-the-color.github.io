# Guess-the-color.github.io

In this project you’ll be learning JavaScript, one of the world’s most popular programing languages. You probably use things built with JavaScript every day, because it is used in every major website, including YouTube, Instagram, Google, and Faceboook. JavaScript also part of many mobile apps and games!

What you will make?

You will make this colour guessing game! In the game, the player gets to see six different colours and one set of RGB (red, green, blue) values and has to guess which colour matches these RGB values.


Change a button’s colour
At the moment, all the buttons on the web page are red. The whole game is based on having different coloured buttons, so you need a way to change a button’s colour!

Colours in computer programs are made up of three different values: R, G, and B, for red, green, and blue. Each value is between 0 and 255, and together, these three values define the 16777216 colours that a computer can display.

For example:

Red is (255, 0, 0)
Green is (0, 255, 0)
Blue is (0, 0, 255)
Purple, which is a mix of red and blue, is (255, 0, 255)
White is all three colour values at full brightness (255, 255, 255)
Black is all three values at zero brightness (0, 0, 0)
So to change a button’s colour, you tell the button to use three values between 0 and 255 as its background colour.

Because you need to do this a few times in the code for your game, you are going to write a function so that your JavaScript program can do most of the work for you.



Use your setButtonColour function to change the colour of the button to, for example:

Green
Purple
Yellow
